- Analysis of the data generated by a sensor to make sure that it’s functioning correctly
- Aggregate the collected information to produce statistics that may help the agency in making decisions about improving the quality of air
    - Allow the calculation of the mean of the quality of air in a circular area specified by the user
    - This mean may be calculated for a given moment, OR for a specified period of time
- Enable selecting one sensor and scoring and ranking all other sensors in terms of similarity to the selected sensor (similarity based on data generated by sensors during a specified period of time) —> to identify areas with similar air quality
- Produce the value of air quality at a precise geographical position at a given moment (/!\ there may or may not be a sensor present at this specific position)
